Hidden HTTP/2 support
Browsers and other clients, including Burp, typically only use HTTP/2 to communicate with servers that explicitly advertise 
support for it via ALPN as part of the TLS handshake.

Some servers support HTTP/2 but fail to declare this properly due to misconfiguration. In such cases, it can appear as though 
the server only supports HTTP/1.1 because clients default to this as a fallback option. As a result, testers may overlook 
viable HTTP/2 attack surface and miss protocol-level issues, such as the examples of HTTP/2 downgrade-based request 
smuggling that we covered above.

To force Burp Repeater to use HTTP/2 so that you can test for this misconfiguration manually:
-   From the Settings dialog, go to Tools > Repeater.

-   Under Connections, enable the Allow HTTP/2 ALPN override option.

-   In Repeater, go to the Inspector panel and expand the Request attributes section.

-   Use the switch to set the Protocol to HTTP/2. Burp will now send all requests on this tab using HTTP/2, regardless of whether the server advertises support for this.


Note
If you're using Burp Suite Professional, Burp Scanner automatically detects instances of hidden HTTP/2 support.
