Magic methods

Magic methods are a special subset of methods that you do not have to explicitly invoke. Instead, they are invoked automatically whenever a particular event or scenario occurs. 
Magic methods are a common feature of object-oriented programming in various languages. They are sometimes indicated by prefixing or surrounding the method name with 
double-underscores.


Developers can add magic methods to a class in order to predetermine what code should be executed when the corresponding event or scenario occurs. 
Exactly when and why a magic method is invoked differs from method to method. One of the most common examples in PHP is __construct(), 
which is invoked whenever an object of the class is instantiated, similar to Python's __init__. 
Typically, constructor magic methods like this contain code to initialize the attributes of the instance. 
However, magic methods can be customized by developers to execute any code they want.


Magic methods are widely used and do not represent a vulnerability on their own. But they can become dangerous when the code that they execute handles 
attacker-controllable data, for example, from a deserialized object. 
This can be exploited by an attacker to automatically invoke methods on the deserialized data when the corresponding conditions are met.


Most importantly in this context, some languages have magic methods that are invoked automatically during the deserialization process. 
For example, PHP's unserialize() method looks for and invokes an object's __wakeup() magic method.

In Java deserialization, the same applies to the ObjectInputStream.readObject() method, which is used to read data from the initial byte stream and essentially acts 
like a constructor for "re-initializing" a serialized object. However, Serializable classes can also declare their own readObject() method as follows:

private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException
{
    // implementation
}


A readObject() method declared in exactly this way acts as a magic method that is invoked during deserialization. 
This allows the class to control the deserialization of its own fields more closely.

You should pay close attention to any classes that contain these types of magic methods. 
They allow you to pass data from a serialized object into the website's code before the object is fully deserialized. 
This is the starting point for creating more advanced exploits.
