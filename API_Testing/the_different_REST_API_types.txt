REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style for designing networked applications


The most common of the HTTP methods are:

GET:        Used to retrieve a representation of a resource.

POST:       Used to create a new resource.

PUT:        Used to modify an existing resource.

DELETE:     Used to remove a resource.

OPTIONS:    Allow a client to inquire about the communication 
            options available on a particular resource without 
            performing any actual resource manipulation

            Basically sees what HTTP method the client is allowed 
            to use

PATCH:      Used to apply partial modifications to a resource
