using hashcat to brute force secret keys command:
hashcat -a 0 -m 16500 <jwt> <wordlist> --show

the wordlist recommended by portswigger: 
https://github.com/wallarm/jwt-secrets.git

using the payload of:
hashcat -a 0 -m 16500 <jwt.txt> <wordlist> --show

I was able to get back the secret key being "secret1"

using this then I based64 encoded it, created a Symmetric key 
with the base64 encdoing of secret1 as the k value, 
then using "sign" in the JSON Web Token tab

then used this to verify me as the administrator and delete the user acrlos and solve the lab :)
