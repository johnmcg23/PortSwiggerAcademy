Finding TE.CL vulnerabilities using timing techniques
If an application is vulnerable to the TE.CL variant of request smuggling, then sending a request 
like the following will often cause a time delay:

"
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Length: 6

0

X
"

Since the front-end server uses the Transfer-Encoding header, it will forward only part of this request, 
omitting the X. The back-end server uses the Content-Length header, expects more content in the message body,
and waits for the remaining content to arrive. 
This will cause an observable time delay.
