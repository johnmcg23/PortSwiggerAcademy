this lab when inputting a very long email field only takes 255 characters, 

therefore we can use the admin email of "dontwannacry.com" as a subdomain 
of the labs email

having the m in dontwannacry.com as the 255th character means anhything payload_str
this will be cut off, i.e. our subdomain

this means having this @dontwannacry.com email address we can then delete users as
we are administrators

we found this out by hitting the /admin endpoints and seeing only users with 
a @dontwannacry.com email can access it
