could use the following to see if there is a field for password in the database:
https://insecure-website.com/user/lookup?username=admin'+%26%26+this.password!%3d'


if we know the username field exists then we can run this:
admin' && this.username!=' 

or this:
admin' && this.foo!='

If the password field exists, you'd expect the response to be identical to the response 
for the existing field (username), but different to the response for the field that 
doesn't exist (foo).

If you want to test different field names, you could perform a dictionary attack, 
by using a wordlist to cycle through different potential field names.
