some of the exciting headers in a JWT include:

jwk (JSON Web Key) - 
Provides an embedded JSON object representing the key.

jku (JSON Web Key Set URL) - 
Provides a URL from which servers can fetch a set of keys containing the correct key.

kid (Key ID) - 
Provides an ID that servers can use to identify the correct key in cases where there are multiple keys to choose from. 
Depending on the format of the key, this may have a matching kid parameter.


following these steps allows for a JWK embedding header injection:

1. With the extension loaded, in Burp's main tab bar, go to the JWT Editor Keys tab.

2. Generate a new RSA key.

3. Send a request containing a JWT to Burp Repeater.

4. In the message editor, switch to the extension-generated JSON Web Token tab and modify the token's payload however you like.

5. Click Attack, then select Embedded JWK. When prompted, select your newly generated RSA key.

6. Send the request to test how the server responds.
