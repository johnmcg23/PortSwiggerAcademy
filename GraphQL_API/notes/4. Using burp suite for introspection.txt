To run introspection:

-   Browse the target application, looking for requests to a GraphQL endpoint.

-   GraphQL services often use similar endpoint suffixes. Look for queries to the following locations:

/graphql
/api
/api/graphql
/graphql/api
/graphql/graphql
These endpoints may also contain a version number as a suffix, for example, /graphql/v1.

-   Right-click the GraphQL request, then select Send to Repeater.

-   In Repeater, right-click anywhere within the Request panel of the message editor, then select GraphQL > Set introspection query to insert an introspection query into the request body.

-   Click Send.

If introspection is enabled, the server should return the full schema of the GraphQL API in its response to your introspection query.



This introspection query works with most GraphQL servers. However, if you are working with an older GraphQL server, it may fail. 
If that happens, right-click anywhere within the Request panel of the message editor, then select GraphQL > Set legacy introspection query and try again.

Right-click anywhere within the Response panel of the message editor, then select GraphQL > Save GraphQL queries to site map.


Each of the available queries that Burp discovered during introspection is saved as a node on the site map. You can examine these queries to find one that 
you want to investigate further, and send them to Intruder or Repeater to start your attack.
