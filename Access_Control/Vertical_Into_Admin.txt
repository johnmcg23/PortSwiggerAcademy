In this lab you are suppose to delete the user carlos using the administrator account

in order to do this you can see the userid is used to identify your own account

therefore tampering with this and changing it to administrator means you are allowed access to the admin account

you can this update password and look in burp to see the password as:
42i1rzse71sauhb859ji

Using this you can then log into the administrator account and delete carlos
by accessing the admin panel
