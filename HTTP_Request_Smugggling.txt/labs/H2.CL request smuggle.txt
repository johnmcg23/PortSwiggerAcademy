This lab is vulnerable to request smuggling because the front-end server downgrades HTTP/2 requests even if they have an ambiguous length.

To solve the lab, perform a request smuggling attack that causes the victim's browser to load and execute a malicious JavaScript file from the exploit server, 
calling alert(document.cookie). The victim user accesses the home page every 10 seconds.




this request solves the lab by executing alert(document.cookie)
