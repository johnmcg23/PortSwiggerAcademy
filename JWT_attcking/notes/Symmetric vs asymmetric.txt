Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. 
This means that the key must be known to all parties involved in the communication, 
which can be a security risk if the key is not handled properly. Examples of symmetric 
encryption algorithms include AES, DES, and RC4.

Asymmetric encryption, on the other hand, uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption 
and a private key for decryption. The public key can be freely distributed, while the 
private key must be kept secret. This solves the key distribution problem of symmetric 
encryption, but it is computationally more expensive. Examples of asymmetric encryption 
algorithms include RSA, DSA, and ECC.
