using the following I was able to smuggle the delete a user into the next request made by a user:

"

"

The front end used Transfer-Encoding, while the backend use content length.

Knowing this I was then able to put my content length to 24, making the backend think 87 was the end of my request
then this would put the delete request onto another user requesting the / page.
