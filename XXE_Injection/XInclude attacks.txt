In this situation, you cannot carry out a classic XXE attack, because you don't control the entire XML document 
and so cannot define or modify a DOCTYPE element. However, you might be able to use XInclude instead

XInclude is a part of the XML specification that allows an XML document to be built from sub-documents. 
You can place an XInclude attack within any data value in an XML document, so the attack can be performed 
in situations where you only control a single item of data that is placed into a server-side XML document.


To perform an XInclude attack, you need to reference the XInclude namespace and provide the path to the file that you wish to include. 

For example:

<foo xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
<xi:include parse="text" href="file:///etc/passwd"/></foo>
