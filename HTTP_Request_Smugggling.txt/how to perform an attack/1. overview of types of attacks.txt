Classic request smuggling attacks involve placing both the Content-Length header and the 
Transfer-Encoding header into a single HTTP/1 request and manipulating these so that the 
front-end and back-end servers process the request differently. The exact way in which this 
is done depends on the behavior of the two servers:

CL.TE: the front-end server uses the Content-Length header and the back-end server uses the Transfer-Encoding header.

TE.CL: the front-end server uses the Transfer-Encoding header and the back-end server uses the Content-Length header.

TE.TE: the front-end and back-end servers both support the Transfer-Encoding header, but one of the servers can be 
induced not to process it by obfuscating the header in some way.
