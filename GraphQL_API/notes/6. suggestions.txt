Suggestions
Even if introspection is entirely disabled, you can sometimes use suggestions to glean information on an API's structure.

Suggestions are a feature of the Apollo GraphQL platform in which the server can suggest query amendments in error messages. 
These are generally used where a query is slightly incorrect but still recognizable (for example, There is no entry for 'productInfo'. 
Did you mean 'productInformation' instead?).

You can potentially glean useful information from this, as the response is effectively giving away valid parts of the schema.

Clairvoyance is a tool that uses suggestions to automatically recover all or part of a GraphQL schema, even when introspection is disabled. 
This makes it significantly less time consuming to piece together information from suggestion responses.

You cannot disable suggestions directly in Apollo. See this GitHub thread for a workaround.
