Go to "Project options" > "Sessions". In the "Session handling rules" panel, click "Add". The "Session handling rule editor" dialog opens.
In the dialog, go to the "Scope" tab. Under "URL Scope", select "Include all URLs".
Go back to the "Details" tab. Under "Rule actions", click "Add" > "Run a macro". Under "Select macro", click "Add" again to open the Macro Recorder.
Select the following sequence of requests:

POST /cart
POST /cart/coupon

Then, click "OK". The Macro Editor opens.

In the list of requests, select GET /cart/order-confirmation?order-confirmed=true. Click "Configure item". In the dialog that opens, click "Add" to create a custom parameter. Name the parameter gift-card and highlight the gift card code at the bottom of the response. Click "OK" twice to go back to the Macro Editor.
Select the POST /gift-card request and click "Configure item" again. In the "Parameter handling" section, use the drop-down menus to specify that the gift-card parameter should be derived from the prior response (response 4). Click "OK".
In the Macro Editor, click "Test macro". Look at the response to GET /cart/order-confirmation?order-confirmation=true and note the gift card code that was generated. Look at the POST /gift-card request. Make sure that the gift-card parameter matches and confirm that it received a 302 response. Keep clicking "OK" until you get back to the main Burp window.
Send the GET /my-account request to Burp Intruder. Use the "Sniper" attack type.
