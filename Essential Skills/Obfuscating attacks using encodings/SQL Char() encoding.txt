Although not strictly a form of encoding, in some cases, you may be able to obfuscate 
your SQL injection attacks using the CHAR()function. This accepts a single decimal or hex code 
point and returns the matching character. 

Hex codes must be prefixed with 0x. 

For example, both CHAR(83) and CHAR(0x53) return the capital letter S.


even if SELECT is blacklisted, the following injection initially appears harmless:
CHAR(83)+CHAR(69)+CHAR(76)+CHAR(69)+CHAR(67)+CHAR(84)

when this is processed as SQL by the application, it will dynamically construct the SELECT keyword.
