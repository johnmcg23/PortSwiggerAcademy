-   The exploit uses toString() to create a string without using quotes. 

-   It then gets the String prototype and overwrites the charAt function for every string. 
    This effectively breaks the AngularJS sandbox. 

-   Next, an array is passed to the orderBy filter. 
    We then set the argument for the filter by again using toString() to create a string and the String constructor property. 
    

-   Finally, we use the fromCharCode method generate our payload by converting character codes into the string x=alert(1). 
    Because the charAt function has been overwritten, AngularJS will allow this code where normally it would not.
