must test the number of columns being returned
by the SQL query in the first place.

Can use the following to test:
' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL FROM table_name-- 

this tests if the application returns 2 columns, 
if it does then we get a 200 response code.

This means we can then modify our malicious
query to look for exact columns for us like
the following:
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users-- 

However, the two values' data types returned
by the databasemust match the query we are 
sending
