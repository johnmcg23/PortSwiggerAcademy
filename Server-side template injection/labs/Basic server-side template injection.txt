This lab is vulnerable to server-side template injection due to the unsafe construction of an ERB template.

To solve the lab, review the ERB documentation to find out how to execute arbitrary code, then delete the morale.txt file from Carlos's home directory.



initially clicking around the website I had noticed a prodcut was out of stock and this was in the url as a message.

Investigating it further i was able to change the message that appeared on screen.

Testing for server side template injection wiht the following in the url message parameter:
<%= 7 * 7 %>


this gave the output as 49, clearly indicating that this was server side template injection.


knowing this I had then to find out the engine it was running on, submitting:
<%=foobar%>

gave the error indicating ruby engine version 2.7.0

knowing this i submitted next was:
<%=+self.methods+%25>

this gave a list of all the methods available to me to use, and after asking chatgpt which one i could use to delete a file
it gave the folloiwng payload:
?message=<%=+instance_eval('File.delete("/home/carlos/morale.txt")')+%25>

this solved the lab.
