Blind XEE occurs when the server does not return data in text format when it fails.

We have to use creative ways to retrive the info when it fails, like getting error messages
to print out the values we are looking or use OAST out-of-band network interactions, sometimes exfiltrating sensitive data within 
the interaction data.
