Discovering schema information
The next step in testing the API is to piece together information about the underlying schema.

The best way to do this is to use introspection queries. Introspection is a built-in GraphQL function that enables you to 
query a server for information about the schema.

Introspection helps you to understand how you can interact with a GraphQL API. It can also disclose potentially sensitive data, 
such as description fields.


Using introspection
To use introspection to discover schema information, query the __schema field. This field is available on the root type of all queries.

Like regular queries, you can specify the fields and structure of the response you want to be returned when running an introspection query. 
For example, you might want the response to contain only the names of available mutations.



Probing for introspection
It is best practice for introspection to be disabled in production environments, but this advice is not always followed.

You can probe for introspection using the following simple query. If introspection is enabled, the response returns the names of all available queries.


    #Introspection probe request

    {
        "query": "{__schema{queryType{name}}}"
    }
