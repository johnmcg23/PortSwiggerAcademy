When probing for logic flaws, you should try removing each parameter in turn and observing what effect this has on the response. 

You should make sure to:

1. Only remove one parameter at a time to ensure all relevant code paths are reached.

2. Try deleting the name of the parameter as well as the value. The server will typically handle both cases differently.

3. Follow multi-stage processes through to completion. Sometimes tampering with a parameter in one step will have an effect 
on another step further along in the workflow.


This applies to both URL and POST parameters, but don't forget to check the cookies too. This simple process can reveal 
some bizarre application behavior that may be exploitable.
