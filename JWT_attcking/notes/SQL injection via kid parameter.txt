# This is the incoming JWT
jwt_header = {
    "alg": "HS256",
    "typ": "JWT",
    "kid": "1 OR 1=1; --"
}

# This is the vulnerable query
query = f"SELECT * FROM keys WHERE id = {jwt_header['kid']}"


In this case, the kid value 1 OR 1=1; -- will make the query return all keys from the database,
because 1 OR 1=1 is always true. The -- comments out the rest of the SQL command, preventing syntax errors.
