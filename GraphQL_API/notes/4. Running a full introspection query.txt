Running a full introspection query
The next step is to run a full introspection query against the endpoint so that you can get as much information on the underlying schema as possible.

The example query below returns full details on all queries, mutations, subscriptions, types, and fragments.


    #Full introspection query

    query IntrospectionQuery {
        __schema {
            queryType {
                name
            }
            mutationType {
                name
            }
            subscriptionType {
                name
            }
            types {
             ...FullType
            }
            directives {
                name
                description
                args {
                    ...InputValue
            }
            onOperation  #Often needs to be deleted to run query
            onFragment   #Often needs to be deleted to run query
            onField      #Often needs to be deleted to run query
            }
        }
    }

    fragment FullType on __Type {
        kind
        name
        description
        fields(includeDeprecated: true) {
            name
            description
            args {
                ...InputValue
            }
            type {
                ...TypeRef
            }
            isDeprecated
            deprecationReason
        }
        inputFields {
            ...InputValue
        }
        interfaces {
            ...TypeRef
        }
        enumValues(includeDeprecated: true) {
            name
            description
            isDeprecated
            deprecationReason
        }
        possibleTypes {
            ...TypeRef
        }
    }

    fragment InputValue on __InputValue {
        name
        description
        type {
            ...TypeRef
        }
        defaultValue
    }

    fragment TypeRef on __Type {
        kind
        name
        ofType {
            kind
            name
            ofType {
                kind
                name
                ofType {
                    kind
                    name
                }
            }
        }
    }

Note:
If introspection is enabled but the above query doesn't run, try removing the onOperation, onFragment, and onField directives 
from the query structure. Many endpoints do not accept these directives as part of an introspection query, and you can often 
have more success with introspection by removing them.
