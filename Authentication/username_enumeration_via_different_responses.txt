In this lab a list of potential usernames and passwords is given.

by first using intruder to do a cluster bomb using the poteential
usernames and passwords you can see therer is 10,000 requests.

this is way too many as it would take too logging

however we notice that putting in an invalid username
we can see that the response is "invalid username"

this means if we can get a valid username then it would return maybe
a different response

to check this we do a brute force of a random password and use the double SrcSet
in burp over the username, then check the length of the response

after doing this we see "archie" is a valid username 

we can then input the archie value into the post request for the username then 
use SS over the password and go through the possible passwords.

doing this we get a 302 response code for the password "robert" and a length
of 188.

this means the username is "archie" and the password is "robert"
