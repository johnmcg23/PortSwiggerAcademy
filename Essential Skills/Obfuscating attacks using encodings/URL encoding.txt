A URL typically looks like this:
[...]/?search=Fish+%26+Chips

Any URL-based input is automatically URL decoded server-side before it is assigned to the relevant variables.

you may be able to smuggle payloads to the back-end application simply by encoding any characters or words that are blacklisted.

For example, in a SQL injection attack, you might encode the keywords, so 

SELECT becomes %53%45%4C%45%43%54 and so on.
