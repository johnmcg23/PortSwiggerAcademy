If you cannot get introspection queries to run for the API you are testing, try inserting a special character after the __schema keyword.

When developers disable introspection, they could use a regex to exclude the __schema keyword in queries. 
You should try characters like spaces, new lines and commas, as they are ignored by GraphQL but not by flawed regex.

As such, if the developer has only excluded __schema{, then the below introspection query would not be excluded.


    #Introspection query with newline

    {
        "query": "query{__schema
        {queryType{name}}}"
    }


If this doesn't work, try running the probe over an alternative request method, as introspection may only be disabled over POST. 

Try a GET request, or a POST request with a content-type of x-www-form-urlencoded.

The example below shows an introspection probe sent via GET, with URL-encoded parameters.


    # Introspection probe as GET request

    GET /graphql?query=query%7B__schema%0A%7BqueryType%7Bname%7D%7D%7D
