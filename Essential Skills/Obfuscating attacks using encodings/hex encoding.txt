Another option when injecting into a string context is to use hex escapes, which represent characters using 
their hexadecimal code point, prefixed with \x. 

For example, the lowercase letter a is represented by \x61.

Just like unicode escapes, these will be decoded client-side as long as the input is evaluated as a string:


eval("\x61lert")


Note that you can sometimes also obfuscate SQL statements in a similar manner using the prefix 0x. 
For example, 
0x53454c454354 may be decoded to form the SELECT keyword.
