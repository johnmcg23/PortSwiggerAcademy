This lab is vulnerable to web cache poisoning because it handles input from an unkeyed header in an unsafe way. 
An unsuspecting user regularly visits the site's home page. 

To solve this lab, poison the cache with a response that executes alert(document.cookie) in the visitor's browser.


In this lab using the param miner extension, I found the unkeyed header to be x-forwarded-host 

using this info putting the host to my exploit server and having a file on the exploit server under the directory of 
"/resources/js/tracking.js" with the body of "alert(document.cookie);"


then cahce poisoning the home page solves the lab.
