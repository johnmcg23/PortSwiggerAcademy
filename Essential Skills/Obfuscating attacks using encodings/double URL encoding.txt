For one reason or another, some servers perform two rounds of URL decoding on any URLs they receive.

Let's say you're trying to inject a standard XSS PoC, such as <img src=x onerror=alert(1)>, via a query parameter. 

In this case, the URL might look something like this:
[...]/?search=%3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3Dalert(1)%3E

Any WAF will typically pick this up...

But what if you double-encode the injection? In practice, this means that the % characters themselves are then replaced with %25:

[...]/?search=%253Cimg%2520src%253Dx%2520onerror%253Dalert(1)%253E


As the WAF only decodes this once, it may not be able to identify that the request is dangerous. 
If the back-end server subsequently double-decodes this input, the payload will be successfully injected.
