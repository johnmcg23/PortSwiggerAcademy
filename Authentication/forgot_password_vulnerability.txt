steps for password reset poisoning:

1. The user enters their username or email address and submits a password reset request.

2. The website checks that this user exists and then generates a temporary, unique, high-entropy token, which it associates with the user's account on the back-end.

3. The website sends an email to the user that contains a link for resetting their password. The user's unique reset token is included as a query parameter in the corresponding URL:
https://normal-website.com/reset?token=0a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j

4. When the user visits this URL, the website checks whether the provided token is valid and uses it to determine which account is being reset. If everything is as expected, the user 
is given the option to enter a new password. Finally, the token is destroyed.
