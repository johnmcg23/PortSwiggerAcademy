some websites dont have their publi keys at the enpoints of:
/jwks.json or /.well-known/jwks.json


For this reason if we have two JWT tokens (log in and out twice) we can use burps docker with the command: (these tokens are just raw and not in .txt files)
docker run --rm -it portswigger/sig2n <token1> <token2>


this command returns two keys, a x509 key and a pkcs1 key.

it also returns the tampered JWT for both of these keys.


To test which works on the server, make the request to your account with both, 
the server will reject one but accept the one that works.

in my case it wwas the x509 key that worked... then I followed the same process as an 
algorithm attack in the previous lab to gain access to the /admin page copying the key value 
into a new generated symmetric key and signed it with the malicious request.
