when the ng-app header is used it means the application could be 
subject to XSS attacks. 

using {{}} an attack can be formed


in this lab the use of:
{{alert(1)}} when searching for thi result comes back null
saying "0 results for" "

this is due to the words being closed in an ng-app directive

using this payload:
{{$on.constructor('alert(1)')()}}

solves the lab



The $ sign just represents it is a function. $on.constructor is constructor 
function when invoked with parameters executes it's argument passed as a string. 
Thus passed with argument it is $on.constructor('alert(1)') and to denote constructor is a function "()" 
is added to look like: $on.constructor('alert(1)')(). This is similar to the following snippet in javascript:

function (){
   alert(1);
}
