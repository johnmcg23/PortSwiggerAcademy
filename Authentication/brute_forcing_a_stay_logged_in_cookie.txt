decoding this in base 64 gives:
wiener:51dc30ddc473d43a6011e9ebba6ca770

this is clearly the username and password however my original password was "peter"

most likely a hash, therefore going to use a kali tool to get the hash

this is an MD5 hash as when reversed peter was got, therefore no salt in the hash 
which is good


to decode the stay logged in cookie is      base64 --> MD5 --> plain text


to encode we go from                        plain text password --> MD5 encode --> carlos:MD5 encoded --> base64 encode
this will give us the stay logged in cookie


we have a list of candidate passwords given to us
