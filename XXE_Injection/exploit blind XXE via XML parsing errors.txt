An alternative approach to exploiting blind XXE is to trigger an XML parsing error 
where the error message contains the sensitive data that you wish to retrieve. 
This will be effective if the application returns the resulting error message within its response.

You can trigger an XML parsing error message containing the contents of the /etc/passwd file using a malicious external DTD as follows:

<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; error SYSTEM 'file:///nonexistent/%file;'>">
%eval;
%error;


This DTD carries out the following steps:

Defines an XML parameter entity called file, containing the contents of the /etc/passwd file.
Defines an XML parameter entity called eval, containing a dynamic declaration of another XML parameter entity called error. The error entity will be evaluated by loading a nonexistent file whose name contains the value of the file entity.
Uses the eval entity, which causes the dynamic declaration of the error entity to be performed.
Uses the error entity, so that its value is evaluated by attempting to load the nonexistent file, resulting in an error message containing the name of the nonexistent file, which is the contents of the /etc/passwd file.
