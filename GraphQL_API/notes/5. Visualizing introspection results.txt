Visualizing introspection results
Responses to introspection queries can be full of information, but are often very long and hard to process.

You can view relationships between schema entities more easily using a GraphQL visualizer. This is an online tool that takes the results 
of an introspection query and produces a visual representation of the returned data, including the relationships between operations and types.
