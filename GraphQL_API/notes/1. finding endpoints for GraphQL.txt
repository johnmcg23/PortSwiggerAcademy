Common endpoint names
GraphQL services often use similar endpoint suffixes. When testing for GraphQL endpoints, 
you should look to send universal queries to the following locations:

/graphql
/api
/api/graphql
/graphql/api
/graphql/graphql
If these common endpoints don't return a GraphQL response, you could also try appending /v1 to the path.


Note:
GraphQL services will often respond to any non-GraphQL request with a "query not present" or similar error. 
You should bear this in mind when testing for GraphQL endpoints.
