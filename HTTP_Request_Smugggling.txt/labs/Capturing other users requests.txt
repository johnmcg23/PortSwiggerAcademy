I am unable to solve this lab due to my network firewall, however I was able to 
exploit this lab on myself which wouldve solved the lab.

first sending this request:

csrf=vlQVyG4fJR8LaQpQy3xUmcxBGwRyBzKw&postId=4&name=name&email=email@email.com&comment=
"

this gets the next user request with the following:

secret=gCPzZCkEQ4O7pxH8rFaWXlPgRyFRZnlT; 
session=OxRbmycGUKkUQuBv3ZMv7HScZhldtU2M

sending this as my cookie then solves the lab.
