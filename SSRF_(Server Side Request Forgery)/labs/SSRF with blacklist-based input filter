This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.

The developer has deployed two weak anti-SSRF defenses that you will need to bypass.




basically 4 things to check for here:

Use an alternative IP representation of 127.0.0.1, such as 2130706433, 017700000001, or 127.1

Register your own domain name that resolves to 127.0.0.1. You can use spoofed.burpcollaborator.net for this purpose

Obfuscate blocked strings using URL encoding or case variation

Provide a URL that you control, which redirects to the target URL. Try using different redirect codes, as well as different protocols for the target URL. For example, switching from an http: to https: URL during the redirect has been shown to bypass some anti-SSRF filters



for this lab i used the following request:
stockApi=http://LoCAlHOST/aDMIN/delete?username=carlos


which only had to manipulate the localhost and admin parts by adding uppercase characters
