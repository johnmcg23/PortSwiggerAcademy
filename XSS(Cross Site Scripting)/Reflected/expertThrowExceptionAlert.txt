5&'},x=x=>{throw/**/onerror=alert,1337},toString=x,window+'',{x:'


breakdown:

postId=5& : This seems to be a part of a query string parameter in an HTTP request. 
It might be part of a URL parameter used in a web application.

'},x=x=>{throw/**/onerror=alert,1337},toString=x,window+'',{x:':

After the postId=5&, the payload begins.
'}, is likely closing some string context or HTML attribute in the target application.

Then, it defines a variable x with an arrow function: x=x=>{...}. 
This function seems to be throwing an error and setting onerror to alert.

toString=x,window+'' is trying to access the window object and convert it to a string, 
essentially trying to execute x.toString() which is the defined function x.

, {x: ''} adds an extra object {x: ''} which doesn't seem to serve any purpose in this payload.
