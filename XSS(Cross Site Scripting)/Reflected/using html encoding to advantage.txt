in this lab the comment section uses a href reference for the 
website field, therefore by somehow breaking out of this we can use
a XSS attack.

This lab encodes certain characters like ' or "

therefore using the encoded values will allow for this payload to work:
&apos;-alert(document.domain)-&apos;
